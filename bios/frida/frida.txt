Made of code and fueled by coffee, Frida Data Cat found us in November 2020, and she's been an indespensable part of our team ever since. Frida has hard-coded allergies to bias and systematic oppression. In her free time, Frida enjoys hunting computer mice, and it's awful. We've spent an ungodly amount of money purchasing new ones. She won't stop. Send help.
